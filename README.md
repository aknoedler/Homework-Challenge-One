# Homework Challenge One- Refactoring

## Description

The goal of this project was to refactor the html and css of a provided webpage
in order to meet best practices, improve accesibility, and make the code easier
to understand. I accomplished this through the following:

-Replaced div elements in the index with semantic tags where possible

-Added alt text to the images in HTML

-Reorganized the CSS style sheet to remove redunant classes

-Ordered the CSS style sheet in a more logical and readable fashion
